# DevExpress.SimpleProjectManager
This is made by the tutorial DevExpress XAF CrossPlatform.
There are only changes in the ProjectManager Module for webapps.
There is important to do the migration so it can create the local data base in this case (PostgreSQL).
I didn't use the sentence DateTime due to the issues between the datatype timestamp.
This was made with EF.
